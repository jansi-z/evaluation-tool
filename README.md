## About

The frontend client for an evaluation tool I made as a final project for my programming course. I made it in React using Redux and some other cool plugins. It interacts with a Feathers API, which you can find here: https://github.com/shakahari/evaluation-tool-api.

This project taught me how to build my own React-Redux app from the ground up. When I got the hang of it I really liked the way Redux reducers work. On top of that, I managed to make it look (mostly) not horrible, so I like to think I got a bit of styling expertise out of it as well!

## Running the app

2. CD into the directory and run yarn install (or npm install if NPM has your preference)
